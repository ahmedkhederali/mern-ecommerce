Cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) :
 These attacks rely on client-side JavaScript being injected into 
 the front-end of your application and then accessing cookies via 
 the browser's JavaScript cookies API.


Man-in-the-middle attacks :
 These attacks occur when a request is in-flight (traveling from the 
 browser to the server) and the server does not have an HTTPS connection (no SSL).


Cross-site tracing attacks (XST) :
 In the HTTP protocol, an HTTP method called TRACE exists which allows attackers to
  send a request to a server (and obtain its cookies) while bypassing any security. 
  While modern browsers generally make this irrelevant due to disabling of the TRACE method, 
  it's still good to be aware of and guard against for added security.
